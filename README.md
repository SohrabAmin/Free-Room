# Free Room

Free Room is a `Python` application that uses [UofT Scrapers](https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/uoft-scrapers) data to provide all the lecture and tutorial rooms that are currently not in use. The goal is to have a visual based chart, where each day of the week shows what room is free in what building.
