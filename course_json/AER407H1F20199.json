{"id": "AER407H1F20199", "code": "AER407H1F", "name": "Space Systems Design", "description": "Introduction to the conceptual and preliminary design phases for a space system currently of interest in the Aerospace industry. A team of visiting engineers provide material on typical space systems design methodology and share their experiences working on current space initiatives through workshops and mock design reviews. Aspects of operations, systems, electrical, mechanical, software, and controls are covered. The class is divided into project teams to design a space system in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP) formulated by the industrial team. Emphasis is placed on standard top-down design practices and the tradeoffs which occur during the design process. Past projects include satellites such as Radarsat, interplanetary probes such as a solar sailer to Mars, a Mars surface rover and dextrous space robotic systems.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "AER301H1, AER372H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["C Damaren"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "MY 315"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}]}
