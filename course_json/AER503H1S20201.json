{"id": "AER503H1S20201", "code": "AER503H1S", "name": "Aeroelasticity", "description": "Static aeroelastic phenomena are studied, including divergence of 2D sections and slender 3D wings, as well as control reversal of 3D wings. Various methods of solution are considered such as closed form, discrete element, and the Rayleigh-Ritz approach. A study of vibration and flutter of wings and control surfaces is presented with particular emphasis on those parameters that affect flutter speed. Classical, k, and p-k methods for flutter estimation are presented.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "AER307H1 and AER501H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Grant"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA B024"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2175"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 9}]}
