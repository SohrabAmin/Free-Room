{"id": "ANT337H1S20201", "code": "ANT337H1S", "name": "Human Movement", "description": "This course will investigate human movement and physical activity patterns through the lens of evolutionary anthropology. The evolution of hominin physical behaviours, such as bipedalism and tool use, will be explored alongside the morphological traits associated with these behaviours. We will also examine social and cultural factors that may moderate physical activities among diverse human groups, including subsistence strategy variation and contemporary views on activity and exercise.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Anthropology", "prerequisites": "ANT203Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "AP 130"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 30}, {"code": "P0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "AP 130"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 12}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Cameron"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "AP 130"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 45}]}
