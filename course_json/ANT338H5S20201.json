Students will be introduced to the process of conducting research, including selected laboratory procedures and how they are used to generate and/or analyze data. Students conduct anthropometric assessment of growth and body size, nutrition assessment through 24-hour dietary recall, and assessment of physical activity and sleep using triaxial accelerometry. These biometric techniques have numerous applications in both research and clinical settings. Students in this course will develop applied skills in bioanthropological assessment that can be used in the fields of anthropology, population health, public health nutrition, and human development.
