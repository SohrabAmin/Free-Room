The fossil record of these apes, our ancestors, reveals how we evolved our large brains, dexterous hands, extended growth period and incredible intelligence. We encounter many surprises along the way, such as apes living with pandas in Hungary, animals with a mix of monkey, ape and pig traits and apes the size of polar bears. Of the more than 100 species of fossil apes known, only one gave rise to us.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Anthropology", "prerequisites": "ANT203Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
