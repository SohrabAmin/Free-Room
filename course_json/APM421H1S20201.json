The core part of the course covers the following topics: Schroedinger equation, quantum observables, spectrum and evolution, motion in electro-magnetic field, angular momentum and O(3) and SU(2) groups, spin and statistics, semi-classical asymptotics, perturbation theory. More advanced topics may include: adiabatic theory and geometrical phases, Hartree-Fock theory, Bose-Einstein condensation, the second quantization, density matrix and quantum statistics, open systems and Lindblad evolution, quantum entropy, quantum channels, quantum Shannon theorems.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Mathematics", "prerequisites": "(MAT224H1, MAT337H1)/MAT357H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Gualtieri"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "RS 208"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 208"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 31}]}
