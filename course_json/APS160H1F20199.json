The equilibrium states of structures are examined. Throughout, the free body diagram concept is emphasized. Vector algebra is used where it is most useful, and stress blocks are introduced. Shear force diagrams, bending moment diagrams and stress-strain relationships for materials are discussed. Stress and deformation in axially loaded members and flexural members (beams) are also covered.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Engineering First Year Office", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "CIV100H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["M Seica"], "times": [], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Seica"], "times": [], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}]}
