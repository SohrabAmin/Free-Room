By providing this context for design and decision-making, students will be enabled to do more than achieve the desired results by also preventing or significantly reducing undesired consequences. A more preventively-oriented mode of practicing engineering will be developed in four areas of application: materials and production, energy, work and cities. The emphasis within these topics will reflect the interests of the class.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}], "size": 140, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["W Vanderburg"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 50400, "duration": 10800, "location": "SF 1101"}], "size": 140, "enrolment": 0}]}
