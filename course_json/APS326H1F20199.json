This exploration will reinforce the iterative principles of the engineering design process and will provide students with flexible and transferable tools for them to apply to future engineering work. They will examine up to two genres of creative writing (fiction, science fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, screenwriting, playwriting, etc.) in order to hone their own creative and critical thinking skills. Students will be introduced to relevant elements of craft, will analyze representative literary examples, will create original creative work both in generative weekly exercises and in longer at-home assignments, will give and receive feedback from their peers through structured in-class workshops, and will apply this feedback to their own writing.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Engineering Communications Program", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Nolan C Wright J Taylor"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 72000, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2155"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 72000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 370"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}]}
