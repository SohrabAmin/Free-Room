{"id": "AST198H1S20201", "code": "AST198H1S", "name": "Great Astronomical Issues", "description": "There are some fundamental questions which humankind has asked itself over the centuries. Many of these involve astronomical origins, events, and objects. Astronomers now have the tools with which to attempt to answer some of the most fundamental questions, such as \"Where did it all begin, where are we in space and time, are we alone, and who and what are we?\" This seminar will explore some of these great issues. The selection of topics will be made initially by the instructor, but will be modified by the seminar participants at the first class meeting. Topics could include: stellar evolution and the future of the Sun, origin of the elements, origin and future of the Universe, origin of the Earth, origin of life, and extinction of the dinosaurs, global warming, the scientific method, astronomy and the public. Participants will be expected to join actively in lively discussions and to prepare and lead some of the seminars. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "AST199H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Friesen"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "LM 123"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 24}]}
