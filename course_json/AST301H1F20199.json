{"id": "AST301H1F20199", "code": "AST301H1F", "name": "Observational Astronomy", "description": "A hands-on introduction to telescopes and observational astronomy for students with little experience in the physical sciences. Through laboratory exercises and observations of the sky, students will learn the techniques that have enabled the major discoveries of modern astronomy, from the expansion of the universe to the existence of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Hands-on activities will teach how telescopes work and how we can measure the distances, motion, and chemical composition of celestial objects. Basic arithmetic is used, but no advanced mathematics. This course is intended for students without a formal science background to gain experience with hands-on observational astronomy.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "prerequisites": "AST101H1/AST201H1/AST251H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 330"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Drout M Reid"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 380"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
