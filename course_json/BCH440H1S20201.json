Structure, assembly, and evolution of the ribosome. 2. Messenger RNA synthesis, maturation, and localization. 3. Mechanisms and regulation of translation initiation. 4. Fidelity during translation elongation. 5. Translation termination and translation-mediated mRNA decay. 6. Nascent protein folding and molecular chaperones. 7. Protein aging, misfolding and disease. 8. Protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. In addition to the lectures, groups of students will interpret a recent paper related to the lecture material to be formally presented during regular class hours.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Biochemistry", "prerequisites": "BCH210H1/BCH242Y1; BCH311H1/MGY311Y1/PSL350H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Glover"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 2170"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 2170"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 26}]}
