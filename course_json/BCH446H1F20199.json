{"id": "BCH446H1F20199", "code": "BCH446H1F", "name": "Membrane Dynamics of the Cell Surface", "description": "This course covers the principles and concepts related to molecular cell biology of the cell surface in multicellular organisms. Topics include: biophysical properties of cells, membranes, and extracellular matrix, dynamic remodelling of the cytoskeleton; cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions; maintenance of planar and apical-basal cell polarity; cytokinesis, viral uptake by macropinocytosis and engulfment by phagocytosis. In addition to lectures, groups of students will interpret a recent scientific paper related to the course material to be formally presented during regular class hours.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Biochemistry", "prerequisites": "BCH210H1/BCH242Y1; BCH311H1/MGY311Y1/PSL350H1.", "exclusions": "CSB331H1, CSB428H1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Fairn A Wilde J Glover"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "PB 255"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
