{"id": "BIO314H5S20201", "code": "BIO314H5S", "name": "Laboratory in Cell and Molecular Biology", "description": "Students are introduced to commonly employed techniques in cell biology such as cellular fractionation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blotting, and immunolocalization. Students will also perform some advanced molecular biology techniques including the cloning and transformation of genes, DNA sequencing and the expression of proteins in bacterial and/or model systems. Each week, a two-hour lecture provides an introduction and theoretical basis for the lab.
