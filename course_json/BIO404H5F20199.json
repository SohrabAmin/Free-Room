{"id": "BIO404H5F20199", "code": "BIO404H5F", "name": "Invertebrate Neurobiology", "description": "Neurobiology, the biological study of the nervous system, investigates the electrical and chemical processes animals use to regulate internal events and interface with their environments. Invertebrates have provided crucial neurobiological insights and are often more accessible study systems than vertebrates. This course addresses some key historical contributions, and discusses the future of invertebrate systems, where recent technological advances are opening up new ways to explore invertebrate neurobiology and evolution. Students will do practicals, using computer simulations of neurons, to develop an understanding of neurons and other excitable cells.
