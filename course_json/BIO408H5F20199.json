{"id": "BIO408H5F20199", "code": "BIO408H5F", "name": "Neural Circuit Structure and Function", "description": "This course covers contemporary topics in systems neuroscience, focusing on the relationship between the circuit structure and function of mammalian brains. We review the current understanding of topics concerning signal transduction and the peripheral circuits, information processing in the central nerve system, neuronal cell types and connectivity, development and critical period plasticity of sensory cortices, and motor control. Students present and critique the latest research progress on these issues.[24L, 12S]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO202H5, BIO304H5 / P.I.", "exclusions": "None", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["B Liu"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MN 2262"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MN 2140"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
