{"id": "BME346H1S20201", "code": "BME346H1S", "name": "Biomedical Engineering and Omics Technologies", "description": "An introduction to the principles and design of fundamental technologies used in biomedical engineering and \u201comics\u201d research. Topics may include but are not limited to tissue culture; spectroscopy; electrophoresis; PCR, genomics, sequencing technologies, and gene expression measurement; protein expression assays and tagging strategies; fluorescence labeling tools, microscopy, and high content imaging; DNA manipulation and transfection, RNAi, and other genetic and molecular tools for transformation of organisms. Laboratories will provide hands-on experience with selected technologies. Students will engage in a major design project in which they will design an experimental plan to investigate a specific research question, also of their design, utilizing available laboratory technologies.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "BME205H1", "exclusions": "BME340H1, BME440H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2165"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 23}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 46800, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 78"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 46800, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 11}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 325"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 78"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 12}]}
