The structures and mechanisms responsible for proper function of these complex systems will be examined in the healthy and diseased human body. The integration of different organ systems will be stressed, with a specific focus on the structure-function relationship. Application of biomedical engineering technologies in maintaining homeostasis will also be discussed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "BME205H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 78"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 325"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 78"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Volchuk"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2159"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
