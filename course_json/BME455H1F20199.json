{"id": "BME455H1F20199", "code": "BME455H1F", "name": "Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering II", "description": "Quantitative approach to understanding cellular behaviour. Using engineering tools (especially derived from transport phenomena and chemical kinetics) to integrate and enhance what is known about mammalian cell behaviour at the molecular level. The course combines mathematical modeling with biology and includes numerical methods, factorial design, statistics, empirical models, mechanistic models and mass transfer. Specific topics include: receptor-ligand interactions, cell adhesion and migration, signal transduction, cell growth and differentiation. Examples from gene therapy, and cellular and tissue engineering are used.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Institute of Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering", "prerequisites": "CHE353H1 and CHE354H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Rocheleau"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "LM 123"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "LM 123"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2179"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
