From the ability for some people to process music via sound and vibration, to the inability of others to parse visual information, perception plays an important part in cognition. In this course students learn the roles that perception - via physiological, experiential, cultural and emotional means - plays in the communication function. Using a deficit or disabilities model students explore stimulation, organization and interpretation, and critically analyse the consequences of technologies for human perception and communication.
