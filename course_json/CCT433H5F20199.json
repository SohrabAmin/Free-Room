During this course, students will apply the process and rhetoric of sustainable systems thinking to the re-design of an object or service applying such methodologies as cradle-to-cradle, 'design-for-environment', pricing based on full cost accounting, greening of the supply chain, and corporate responsibility. Throughout the course, students will examine the need for sustainable design through case studies, best practice analyses, and relevant readings.
