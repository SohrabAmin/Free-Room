{"id": "CCT482H5S20201", "code": "CCT482H5S", "name": "Interactive Electronic Design (SH)", "description": "This course investigates the emerging field of critical making, which encourages students to approach social, communication and cultural issues through material engagement versus the literal and oral media more traditionally used in social science research. Students will not only explore core tensions and challenges regarding technology's role and influence in society, but engage these challenges directly through the design and physical creation of alternative technological prototypes. Basic mechanics, electronics and programming will be taught, with an understanding that thinking materially is rare for many most social science students. No previous knowledge is assumed.
