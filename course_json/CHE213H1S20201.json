{"id": "CHE213H1S20201", "code": "CHE213H1S", "name": "Applied Chemistry II - Organic Chemistry", "description": "Topics include the structure, bonding and characteristic reactions of organic compounds including additions, eliminations, oxidations, reductions, radical reactions, condensation/hydrolysis and rearrangements. The chemical relationships and reactivities of simple functional groups are discussed with an emphasis placed on reaction mechanisms involving the formation of organic intermediates, chemicals and polymers. An introduction will be given on biologically relevant compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Examples will be discussed which outline the usefulness of these reactions and chemicals within the broader chemical industry.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 360"}], "size": 65, "enrolment": 56}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 330"}], "size": 65, "enrolment": 57}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["T Bender"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1180"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1180"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 113}]}
