{"id": "CHE451H1F20199", "code": "CHE451H1F", "name": "Petroleum Processing", "description": "This course is aimed at surveying the oil industry practices from the perspective of a block flow diagram. Oil refineries today involve the large scale processing of fluids through primary separation techniques, secondary treating plus the introduction of catalyst for molecular reforming in order to meet the product demands of industry and the public. Crude oil is being shipped in increasing quantities from many parts of the world and refiners must be aware of the properties and specifications of both the crude and product slates to ensure that the crude is a viable source and that the product slate meets quality and quantity demands thus assuring a profitable operation. The course content will examine refinery oil and gas operations from feed, through to products, touching on processing steps necessary to meet consumer demands. In both course readings and written assignments, students will be asked to consider refinery operations from a broad perspective and not through detailed analysis and problem solving.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Norval"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 119"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 119"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
