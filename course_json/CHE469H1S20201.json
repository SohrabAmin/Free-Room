{"id": "CHE469H1S20201", "code": "CHE469H1S", "name": "Fuel Cells and Electrochemical Conversion Devices", "description": "The objective of this course is to provide a foundation for understanding the field of electrochemical conversion devices with particular emphasis on fuel cells. The topics will proceed from the fundamental thermodynamic in-system electodics and ionic interaction limitations to mass transfer and heat balance effects,t o the externalities such as economics and system integration challenges. Guest lecturers from the fuel cell industry will be invited to procide an industrial perspective. Participants will complete a paper and in-class presentation.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "MIE517H1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "HA 410"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 12}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Kirk"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "HA 409"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "HA 409"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 12}]}
