{"id": "CHM195H1F20199", "code": "CHM195H1F", "name": "Innovative Teaching Methods in Chemistry", "description": "Good teaching is effective communication that engages the audience. In this breadth course, we'll explore innovative teaching in science, through an examination of the nature of science, how scientific knowledge is built, and what makes certain concepts in science problematic to the learner. Students will read and discuss relevant articles in newsmagazines, popular science sources, and educational literature. They will design and deliver mini-lessons to communicate specified scientific concepts. As a major course project, students will develop a communication tool that integrates pedagogical know-how with leading-edge chemical discoveries to produce a teaching unit for use by Ontario teachers. Restricted to first-year students.
