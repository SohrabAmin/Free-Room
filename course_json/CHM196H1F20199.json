{"id": "CHM196H1F20199", "code": "CHM196H1F", "name": "The Quantum World and Its Classical Limit", "description": "This course seeks to demystify quantum mechanics and equip students to critically analyze popular depictions of quantum phenomena. While quantum mechanics provides a reliable description of the behavior of atoms, molecules and photons, most people are uncomfortable with some of its predictions, such as \"quantum entanglement\" between distant particles. In this course we will delve into key aspects of quantum mechanics and its more comfortable classical limit, focusing first on its manifestations in nature and then on fundamental issues such as uncertainty, interference, entanglement, and decoherence. This course will appeal to students with enthusiasm for physics. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "Other FYF classes", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Brumer"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2159"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
