The ideas and methods have evolved from diverse inputs leading to widely accepted sets of standard of facts. This collective knowledge has led to progress in the quality and understanding of life at a molecular level. While the facts of chemistry are taught in established courses, the context of what we know, the limitations and challenges of what chemistry can do and how we got to this point will be the targets for discovery by students in this course. The course will operate in a seminar model, combining presentations, readings, reports and discussions of current and historical issues. Restricted to first-year students.
