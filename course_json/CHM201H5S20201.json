{"id": "CHM201H5S20201", "code": "CHM201H5S", "name": "The Science of Human Health", "description": "This course is intended for humanities and social science students who wish to gain knowledge of the science behind our well-being that may help them to make personal, social and political decisions in their future. Chemistry will be taught on a need-to-know basis in order to consider some contemporary applications. The course will focus on three themes in the realm of human health: nutrition for the prevention of disease, diagnostic tests for the detection of disease and drug discovery for the treatment of disease. Among the questions that may be addressed are \"What is the nutritional difference between vitamins from foods and those from supplements?\", \"Should ketchup be considered a vegetable?\", \"How do diagnostic strips work?\", \"What advances in microfluidics have provided inexpensive diagnostics for use in remote areas?\", \"How are drug targets identified?\", and \"What is the path from drug discovery to bringing a drug to market?\". The roles of nutritional, analytical and medicinal chemistry in these processes will be studied.
