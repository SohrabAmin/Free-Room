{"id": "CHM249H1S20201", "code": "CHM249H1S", "name": "Organic Chemistry", "description": "An introductory course in organic chemistry, based around the themes of structure, bonding, reaction mechanism and synthesis. Reactions are discussed with a view to understanding mechanism and how they are useful in the multi-step synthesis of medicinally and industrially important compounds. An introduction to the spectroscopy of organic molecules is also given, as well as discussion of topics relating to the biological behaviour of organic molecules and medicinal chemistry. Students are also introduced to green chemistry approaches from an experimental perspective. This course continues from CHM151Y1 or CHM138H1 and is designed for students enrolled in any chemistry specialist or major program. This course is highly recommended for students in the Biological Chemistry Specialist program.
