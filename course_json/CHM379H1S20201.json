{"id": "CHM379H1S20201", "code": "CHM379H1S", "name": "Biomolecular Chemistry", "description": "This course provides an opportunity to learn core techniques in biological chemistry in a small group laboratory setting. It provides excellent preparation for a CHM499Y1 project in biological chemistry or related areas. Lectures will discuss the theory behind the techniques and highlight how they are used in modern biological chemistry research and practice. Note: CHM379H1 can be used as the biochemistry lab requirement for students completing double majors in chemistry and biochemistry. (Lab Materials Fee: $25).", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Chemistry", "prerequisites": "(CHM247H1/CHM249H1 with a minimum grade of 63%), CHM347H1, BCH210H1", "exclusions": "BCH370H1, CHM371H5", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Woolley"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 57"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 57"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 10}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["G Woolley"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 46800, "duration": 14400, "location": "LM 6"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 9}]}
