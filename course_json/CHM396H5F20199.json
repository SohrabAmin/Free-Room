{"id": "CHM396H5F20199", "code": "CHM396H5F", "name": "Analytical and Physical Chemistry Instrumentation Laboratory I", "description": "This analytical and physical chemistry laboratory course represents an integration of the study of fundamental physical chemistry with wide-ranging applications to instrumental methods of analysis, such as separation science, electrochemistry and spectroscopy. The course will provide a solid hands-on grounding in many of the major topics covered in analytical and physical chemistry, and the optimization of instrumental analytical measurements by the application of physical principles. Students select from a variety of instruments to customize their program, and develop their own analytical methods to address analytical problems of interest to the student.
