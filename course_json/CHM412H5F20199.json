{"id": "CHM412H5F20199", "code": "CHM412H5F", "name": "Analytical Methods of Biomolecule Analysis", "description": "An exploration of biomolecule analysis methodologies, with an emphasis on nucleic acid analysis, will be done from the perspective of the Analytical Biochemist. The course will begin with brief reviews of the structure and function of biomolecules, solid-phase synthesis, extraction, pre-concentration and amplification methods. This will be followed by an exploration of established and emerging techniques for target biomolecule determinations, including: bioprobes, microarrays, biosensors and DNA sequencing technologies (including single molecule approaches). Current examples of implementation in the fields of proteomics and genomics will be discussed throughout the course, with an emphasis on life sciences and diagnostic testing applications. Course work will include independent literature reviews and student presentations.
