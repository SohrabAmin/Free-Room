{"id": "CHM444H5S20201", "code": "CHM444H5S", "name": "An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Recognition", "description": "An introduction to drug discovery, design and development. This course will focus on the potential of proteins (enzymes, receptors, receptor structure and signal transduction) as targets for molecular therapeutic intervention. The strategies of finding a drug target, optimizing target interactions and synthetic molecular therapeutic development will all be considered and discussed. The modern technologies of targeting protein-protein interactions will also be covered.
