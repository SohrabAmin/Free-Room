The research topic must not overlap that of the student's CHM485H5 research topic. In addition to learning to plan, conduct and evaluate a research program, students will receive training in written and oral presentation skills. Evaluation is based on interim and final written reports describing the aims and results of the research, as well as interim and final oral presentations of the work. The course is normally taken in the student's fourth year.

Acceptance into the course is dependent on the student having achieved a satisfactory GPA, and reaching agreement with a potential supervisor. Students must consult with prospective supervisors before applying for enrolment, and must list at least two faculty members as possible supervisors. This course is restricted to students in the Chemistry Majors, Biological Chemistry Specialist, and Chemistry Specialist Programs [240P]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Chemical and Physical Sciences", "prerequisites": "2.0 300 level credits in CHM/JCP and\u00ff1.0 credit from BIO206H5, 314H5; CHM372H5, 373H5, 394H5, 395H5, 396H5, 397H5; PHY324H5, with 0.5 credits from the 300-level CHM laboratory courses listed.", "exclusions": "CHM499Y1; JCB487Y5; CHMD90Y3", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["J Strautmanis"], "times": [], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
