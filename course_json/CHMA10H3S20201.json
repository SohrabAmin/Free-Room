{"id": "CHMA10H3S20201", "code": "CHMA10H3S", "name": "Introductory Chemistry I: Structure and Bonding", "description": "This course will introduce the study of chemical properties and transformations of matter. The course starts with the quantum mechanical model of the atom and the principles of how the periodic table is organized. Key reaction types are explored including acid/base, redox, and precipitation as well as a quantitative description of gases. Bonding and structure in chemical compounds is examined followed by a close look at solutions, solids and intermolecular forces. The course concludes with nuclear chemistry. This course includes a three-hour laboratory every other week.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "CHM120H5, CHM151Y1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L60", "instructors": ["M Zimmer-De Iuliis"], "times": [], "size": 200, "enrolment": 74}, {"code": "L01", "instructors": ["M Zimmer-De Iuliis"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SW 309"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "HW 216"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SW 319"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 75}, {"code": "P0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 22}, {"code": "P0002", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 19}, {"code": "P0003", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "P0004", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "P0005", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 22}, {"code": "P0006", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 16}, {"code": "P0007", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 10}, {"code": "P0008", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 10}, {"code": "P0009", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0010", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0011", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0012", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
