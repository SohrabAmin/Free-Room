{"id": "CHMD11H3F20199", "code": "CHMD11H3F", "name": "Application of Spectroscopy in Chemical Structure Determination ", "description": "In this course students will learn about the following analytical techniques used in organic structure determination: mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. There will be focus on a systematic approach in structure determination through various spectroscopy. Students will receive hands-on training in spectral interpretation, processing and analysis as well as training on the use of different computer software for the purpose of analysis.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "CHMB16H3 and CHMC11H3", "exclusions": "CHM442H5", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": []}
