{"id": "CIN216H1F20199", "code": "CIN216H1F", "name": "Crime Film Traditions", "description": "Originating in the mid-19th century from journalistic accounts and detective stories, crime fiction has emerged as one of the dominant popular genres in the 20th century across a variety of media and platforms, from true crime dime novels to radio dramas, from hard-boiled literature to prestige television series. Rejuvenated in the 21st century by the consolidation of gaming culture and the rise of podcasting, crime narratives have expanded to transmediality, stretching the boundaries between fiction and documentary practices. In this context, the culturally porous and generically elastic crime film had remained one of the most enduring cinematic expressions of sociopolitical anxieties related to class, gender, race, and ethnicity. This course examines a selection of crime film traditions across various geographical areas and historical periods, investigating the resilience of this form from the silent period to the present day.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cinema Studies Institute", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 3023"}], "size": 29, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 3023"}], "size": 29, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0301", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 3023"}], "size": 29, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0401", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 3023"}], "size": 29, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0501", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 3023"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0601", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 3023"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T5101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 3023"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["B Wright"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "IN 112"}], "size": 200, "enrolment": 0}]}
