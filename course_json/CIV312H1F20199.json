{"id": "CIV312H1F20199", "code": "CIV312H1F", "name": "Steel and Timber Design", "description": "An introduction to structural engineering design. Topics discussed include safety and reliability, load and resistance, probability of failure, performance factors, and material properties. A study of basic steel design examines tension members, compression members, beams, framing concepts and connections. Plasticity and composite action in steel structural systems are also discussed. Timber design aspects include beams, compression members and connections.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CIV214H1, CIV235H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Mortazavi"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 116"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["P Mortazavi"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "HA 403"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": ["P Mortazavi"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 2202"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
