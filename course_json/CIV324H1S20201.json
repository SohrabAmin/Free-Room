{"id": "CIV324H1S20201", "code": "CIV324H1S", "name": "Geotechnical Engineering II", "description": "Building on CME321, more complex aspects of geotechnical analysis and design are considered. Topics include: mineralogy; soil identification and classification; laboratory- and field-based soil index tests; correlations of index test results to engineering properties; vertical stress distribution; soil-foundation interaction; volume change and consolidation of clay and settlement. Shear strength of soil and slope stability analysis are also discussed. Laboratories are held for soil identification and classification, and confined triaxial compression tests of clay and sand.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CME321H1.", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["M Ghafghazi"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "GB 308"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 53}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": ["M Ghafghazi"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "GB 308"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 60}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["M Ghafghazi"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1180"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 113}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Batenipour"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1180"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 252"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 113}]}
