{"id": "CIV510H1S20201", "code": "CIV510H1S", "name": "Solid Mechanics II", "description": "This course provides a continuing study of the mechanics of deformable solids. Stress and equilibrium conditions, strain and compatibility conditions, stress-strain relations and yield/failure criteria are considered in the context of civil engineering materials. Two-and three-dimensional elasticity theory is developed, with an introduction to the use of tensor notation. Advanced topics in bending, shear and torsion of beams are also covered, as is elementary plate bending theory. The course concludes with a further development and application of energy methods including virtual work, potential energy, strain energy, and related approaches.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CME210H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["F Azhari"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA B026"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 9}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["F Azhari"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "HA 410"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 119"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 12}]}
