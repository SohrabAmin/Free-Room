{"id": "CLA196H1F20199", "code": "CLA196H1F", "name": "Homer's Odyssey down through Time", "description": "This course will survey creative works inspired by Homer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Odyssey. First we will read through the Odyssey, contextualizing the Homeric epic within the larger story of the Trojan War and the subsequent heroic return in the \"Epic Cycle.\" Then we will study various \"receptions\" of the Odyssey, ancient and modern. Ancient works will include the satyr play Cyclops by Euripides and portrayals of a love-sick Cyclops in Theocritus and Ovid. In True Story Lucian calls Odysseus a liar but rivals his travel tale with episodes placed on the moon and inside a whale. Modern works include Atwood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Penelopiad, Walcott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stage version of the Odyssey, and the film \u00e2\u20ac\u0153O Brother, Where Art Thou?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Themes will include travel literature, truth and lying, localization of the wanderings of Odysseus, culture clash, and the definition of home. All this material, various in date, media, and fidelity to their Homeric source, will provide us with a well-rounded sense of how the Odyssey has been re-imagined over the ages.
