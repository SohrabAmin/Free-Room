Every culture elaborates a variety of answers to this question, resorting to different approaches in order to discuss, represent and attempt to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontrol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the end of human life. Ancient Greeks and Romans articulated their responses to the problem through philosophical and historical-ethnographic inquiries, through the figurative arts, and through myth and poetry. Death, funeral, and mourning were in antiquity at the centre of complex social rituals, often crucial to the construction of a community\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s identity. Mass casualties in war or following disastrous events, while causing exceptional bereavement, also engendered artistic monumentalization. At the core of ancient responses to the mystery of death, however, are attempts to imagine the specifics of the afterlife (its setting, nature and quality), or else to deny such an afterlife altogether. The seminar will focus on Greco-Roman answers to the problems of death and afterlife, with an interest in the various practices of funeral and mourning, a consideration of funerary monuments, and a special focus on mythical and literary representations of the Underworld.
