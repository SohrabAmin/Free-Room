Beginning with a study of the lithosphere, principles of physical geology will be examined including the evolution and internal structure of the earth, dynamic processes that affect the earth, formation of minerals and rocks and soil, ore bodies and fossil- energy sources. Next, the biosphere will be studied, including the basic concepts of ecology including systems ecology and biogeochemical cycles. The influence of humans and the built environment on these natural systems will also be examined with a view to identifying more sustainable engineering practices. Finally, students will study the oceans and the atmosphere and the physical, chemical and thermodynamic processes involved in climate change.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Engineering First Year Office", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 2119"}], "size": 100, "enrolment": 66}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 1062"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 60}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 255"}], "size": 70, "enrolment": 64}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MB 400"}], "size": 98, "enrolment": 62}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["K Peterson"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 1105"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1105"}], "size": 222, "enrolment": 127}]}
