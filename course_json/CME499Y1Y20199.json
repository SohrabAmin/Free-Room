The individual project can have either a design project focus or a research focus. If the focus is on design then the design project can be either motivated by the\u00a0CIV498H1\u00a0Group Design Project experience, or it can be entirely new. The student\u2019s work must culminate in a final design report or a thesis, as well as an oral presentation. The grading of both the final written submission as well as the oral presentation is carried out by the supervising faculty member. The Individual Project may be undertaken in either the Fall (F) or Winter (S) Session, but not both (i.e., the Individual Project carries a maximum weight of 0.5; it cannot be made into a full year course)", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["E Bentz"], "times": [], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
