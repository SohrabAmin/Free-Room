In this course, we will teach students to find reliable sources of information in order to understand the basic concepts underlying the research reported in these media releases, with the ultimate aim of critically evaluating these reports. Through exploration of various media articles in cell and molecular biology (with an emphasis on humans), students will be able to apply what they have learned to current events, as well as relevant issues in their lives and society as a whole. Students will be assessed through short-written assignments, class discussions, an oral presentation, and a final project where they will get the opportunity to explore the research behind a media article of their choice. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Neumann"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 430"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 23}]}
