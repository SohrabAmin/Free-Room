{"id": "CSB348H1S20201", "code": "CSB348H1S", "name": "Laboratory in Comparative Animal Physiology", "description": "Laboratory exercises will include traditional and guided inquiry approaches to investigate and gain an understanding of the regulation of physiological systems in vertebrates and invertebrates. Students will experience the nature of physiological investigation while being exposed to a range of the current experimental approaches animal physiologists use to design, test and evaluate hypotheses, and communicate their findings. This course will emphasize the fundamental characteristics humans share with all animal life and the physiological adaptations that have permitted species to exploit alternative environmental niches. (Lab Materials Fee: $50). Lab coat and safety glasses are required for use in laboratories; students are responsible for purchasing these items (approximate cost is $25).", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO270H1, BIO271H1", "exclusions": "PSL372H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Garside"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": ""}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": ""}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 15}]}
