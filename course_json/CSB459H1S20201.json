Topics include strategies for generating transgenic plants and regulating gene expression, as well as the importance of signal transduction in plant growth and survival. How plants sense and respond at the molecular level to environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, cold and disease will be discussed. The application of this basic scientific information in biotechnological strategies for improving agronomic traits will also be addressed.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "BCH311H1/CSB349H1/MGY311Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Goring"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 4000"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 40}]}
