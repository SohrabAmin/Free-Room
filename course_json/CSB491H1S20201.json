{"id": "CSB491H1S20201", "code": "CSB491H1S", "name": "Team-Based Research: Research in Cell and Molecular Biology", "description": "CSB491H1 will build on molecular biology and biochemistry approaches acquired in CSB350H1 to investigate the role of metabolic enzymes in plants. Students will work in teams to address a specific aspect of a research project. They will develop laboratory and teamwork skills that are desirable for them to function in a research laboratory and in the workplace. The course will integrate current molecular biology techniques, including designing and characterizing mutants made with CRISPR/Cas9, identifying protein interactors, and performing structural and mechanistic analysis of metabolic enzymes. (Lab Materials Fee: $50). Lab coat and safety glasses are required for use in laboratories; students are responsible for purchasing these items (approximate cost is $25).", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "CSB350H1 with a minimum grade of 77% and approval of the instructor", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["W Moeder D Christendat E Nambara"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 4076"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "ES 4076"}], "size": 16, "enrolment": 6}]}
