{"id": "CSC197H1F20199", "code": "CSC197H1F", "name": "What, Who, How: Privacy in the Age of Big Data Collection", "description": "The rapid advance of technology has brought remarkable changes to how we conduct our daily lives, from how we communicate, consume news and data, and purchase goods. As we increase our online activity, so too do we increase the amount of personal data that we're sharing, often without realizing it. The questions of exactly what data is being collected, who is collecting and accessing this data, and how this data is being used, have significant implications for both individuals and our larger social and political institutions. Organized by a wide variety of case studies drawn from current events, we'll study how personal data can be collected and tracked, how personal and social factors may influence our own decisions about whether and how much to share our data, and what broader political and legal tools are used to either protect or subvert individual privacy. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Computer Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Liu"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "IN 312"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
