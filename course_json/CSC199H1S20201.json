How productive/reductive is the brain-computer analogy? What ethical challenges are posed by AI on workers, society, and the environment? Can we put a hold on \"progress\"? Is Silicon Valley the seat of a new techno-religion? What can they teach us about today's research priorities? What insight (or inspiration) can we get from works of science fiction about the future of human-AI interaction? Through reading discussion, written assignment, and workshops, this seminar will present students with the opportunity to integrate their computer science interests with philosophy, history, and literature. There is an equivalent course offered by St. Michael\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College. Students may take one or the other but not both. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Computer Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "SMC199H1 (Intelligence, Artificial and Human)", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Penn"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 4000"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 30}]}
