Brief introduction to NP-completeness: polynomial time reductions, examples of various NP-complete problems, self-reducibility. Additional topics may include approximation and randomized algorithms. Students will be expected to show good design principles and adequate skills at reasoning about the correctness and complexity of algorithms.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Computer Science", "prerequisites": "CSC263H1/CSC265H1", "exclusions": "CSC375H1.
