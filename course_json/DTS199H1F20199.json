{"id": "DTS199H1F20199", "code": "DTS199H1F", "name": "The Bible and Migration", "description": "From the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden to the border-crossings in the book of Ruth and the journey of Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem, the Bible speaks powerfully and in many voices about the experience of displacement and migration. These stories continue to play a complex and important role in modern literature and contemporary debates about migration and migrants. Our course will explore biblical narratives and laws about sojourners, strangers, foreigners, refugees and migrants, follow the paths of these travelers into later religious and political discourse, and attend to the reverberations of these journeys in contemporary art, literature and political discourse. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Centre for Diaspora & Transnational Studies", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["N Seidman P Klassen"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "IN 313"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
