{"id": "ECE422H1S20201", "code": "ECE422H1S", "name": "Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems", "description": "Analysis and design of systems employing radio waves, covering both the underlying electromagnetics and the overall system performance aspects such as signal-to-noise ratios. Transmission/reception phenomena include: electromagnetic wave radiation and polarization; elementary and linear dipoles; directivity, gain, efficiency; integrated, phased-array and aperture antennas; beam-steering; Friis transmission formula and link budget. Propagation phenomena include: diffraction and wave propagation over obstacles; multipath propagation; atmospheric and ionospheric effects. Receiver design aspects include: radio receiver architectures, receiver figures of merit, noise in cascaded systems, noise figure, and noise temperature. System examples are: terrestrial communication systems; satellite communications; radar; radiometric receivers; software-defined radio.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Edward S.
