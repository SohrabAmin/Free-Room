We then look at Irving Fisher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1907 foundation of the modern concept of the interest rate and the present value of capital before reviewing J.M. Keynes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 1936 criticism of neo-classical positions on full employment and interest rates in arguing for government manipulation of interest rates to ensure full employment. We finish with Milton Friedman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s championing of the unregulated market economy through his quantity theory of money critique of Keynes.
