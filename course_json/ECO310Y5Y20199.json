Emphasis is on the operation of imperfectly competitive markets and the interaction between firms. Strategic decisions by firms, such as pricing, R&D, entry, and patenting, are discussed at length using game theory. Case studies of particular industries supplement the material. Government policies affecting the private sector are also studied in detail: Regulation and deregulation of specific industries, trade policies and antidumping, and competition policy.
