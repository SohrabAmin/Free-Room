Understanding the nature and the sources of this great transformation is important for at least two reasons. First, it may provide valuable lessons of economic development for other developing countries. Second, the Chinese economy has become increasingly integrated with the world economy. The growth prospect of China is important for both China and the rest of the world. This course will examine China's growth and development through the lens of the modern macroeconomic theory. The topics that will be covered in the course include China's historical growth performance, structural transformation and growth since 1978, resource reallocation and aggregate productivity changes, financial sector development, inflation and business cycles in China.
