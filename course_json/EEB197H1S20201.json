In this seminar we will explore the diversity of animal and plant species comprising the ecological community that we call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We will learn their names, whether they are endemic (from here originally) or newcomers, general aspects of their biology that suit them to living in an urban environment, how natural selection shapes the traits similarly and differently for species in urban versus wilderness settings, and what happens when the wild and the domesticated members of the community meet one another. For non-science students in all years and disciplines. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Rochman"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "IN 312"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 23}]}
