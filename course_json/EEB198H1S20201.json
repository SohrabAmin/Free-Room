{"id": "EEB198H1S20201", "code": "EEB198H1S", "name": "Genes and Behaviour", "description": "In this course you will experience the new paradigm in behaviour genetic research. You will learn why the concept of a nature-nurture dichotomy is pass\u00c3\u00a9 and that it has been replaced by a new understanding gained from animal and human research in the areas of gene by environment interaction and epigenetics. We will discuss how our genome listens to our environment and the effect this has on our health and behaviour. We will learn why our early experiences are critical for the development of our brains and our bodies. Together this new body of knowledge will help us understand how individual differences in behaviour and health arise. For non-science students in all years and disciplines. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Sokolowski"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 3087"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 24}]}
