{"id": "ENGD05H3S20201", "code": "ENGD05H3S", "name": "Diasporic-Indigenous Relations on Turtle Island", "description": "In this course we consider the possibilities opened up by literature for thinking about the historical and ongoing relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people on the northern part of Turtle Island (the Iroquois, Anishinabek and Lenape name for North America). How does literature written by both diasporic and Indigenous writers call upon readers to act, identify, empathize and become responsible to history, to relating, and to what effect? Students will have the opportunity to consider how literature can help address histories of colonial violence by helping us to think differently about questions about land, justice, memory, community, the environment, and the future of living together, in greater balance, on Turtle Island.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "English (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "1.0 credit at the C-level in ENG courses", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["K Vernon"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 50400, "duration": 10800, "location": "BV 359"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 21}]}
