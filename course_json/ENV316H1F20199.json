{"id": "ENV316H1F20199", "code": "ENV316H1F", "name": "Laboratory and Field Methods in Environmental Science", "description": "This course focuses on methods of sampling and analyzing natural air, water and solid Earth materials for physical, chemical and biological properties that are relevant to current environmental issues. It will integrate approaches from chemistry, physics, geology and biology, and cover techniques in field sampling, laboratory analyses and analyses of large environmental data sets. Basic concepts related to quality control will be emphasized throughout the course: sample collection and storage methods, calibration of field and lab instruments, analyses in complex matrices, errors (accuracy, precision), and detection limits. A fee of approximately $15 may be charged for field trip transportation.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "School of Environment", "prerequisites": "ENV234H1, ENV237H1/ENV238H1, one of CHM210H1/ESS262H1, one of STA220H1/STA288H1/EEB225H1/GGR270H1", "exclusions": "ESS425H1/ENV315H1 (Chemical Analysis of Environmental Samples)", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["N Rollinson H Peng"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "RW 107"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
