{"id": "ERS203H5S20201", "code": "ERS203H5S", "name": "Rock Forming Processes", "description": "Deep beneath volcanoes lie magmatic systems where magma is formed and evolves. These systems are directly related to plate tectonics and the structure and chemistry of the Earth. This course will study these systems ? how they are formed, and why they evolve, as well as what they lead to; volcanic eruptions. This course will use rock specimens, thin sections and geochemistry to study igneous and volcanic rocks, the metamorphic rocks that are associated with magmatic systems, and the economic geology of ore bodies of igneous origin.
