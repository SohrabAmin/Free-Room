{"id": "ERS211H5F20199", "code": "ERS211H5F", "name": "Sedimentology and Stratigraphy", "description": "Sedimentology and stratigraphy concerns the origin, formation, accumulation, alteration, and preservation of sediments in the geological record. This course will focus on the reconstruction, correlation, and interpretation of ancient carbonate and siliciclastic paleoenvironments and facies based on the analysis of sedimentary structures, depositional environments, stratigraphic successions, and fossils. The interplay between biological and geological factors responsible for sedimentary deposits will form the core of the course, including the physical transport and biological accumulation of sediments, the effects of climate-driven sea-level change on sediment deposition, the importance of resource management and sustainability. This course will include a laboratory component with hand samples, thin sections, and physical models, in addition to a field trip, allowing for first-hand experience with describing and interpreting sedimentological units.
