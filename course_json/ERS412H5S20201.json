Topics to be addressed will include paleoclimatic reconstruction, climate and climatic variation, dating methods, and climate proxies. In addition, periods of past climate change will be highlighted with particular emphasis on climate change during the recent past. This will be put into perspective with modern day and future global change [36L] ERS412H5 is offered in alternate years, alternating with ERS312H5.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Chemical and Physical Sciences", "prerequisites": "Two of:\u00ffERS201H5, ERS202H5, ERS203H5", "exclusions": "ESS205H1, 461H1; EESB03H3; ERS321H5", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
