{"id": "ESC101H1F20199", "code": "ESC101H1F", "name": "Praxis I", "description": "Praxis I is the cornerstone course of the Engineering Science Foundation Design sequence and introduces the foundational models and tools of engineering design, communication, teamwork, and professionalism that underlie design education within Engineering Science. In Praxis I students work both individually and in small teams to develop their knowledge and skills in through a combination of active lectures, structured interactive studios, and hands-on practical sessions. The design projects in Praxis I are scoped to the individual student and the broader University community. Each student and team is responsible for both defining and resolving their own opportunities. Praxis I also supports students as they transition into their engineering studies and into the Engineering Science learning community. This support integrates conceptual models, concrete techniques, and University resources, and addresses both academic and non-academic concerns. All courses within the Foundation Design sequence use engineering design to provide a context in which students integrate their knowledge, develop their emerging engineering identity, and codify their individual approach to engineering practice.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "APS111H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Foster R Irish P Sheridan"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 150"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 150"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 150"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 480"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 420"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 440"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0105", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 490"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 480"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0106", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 420"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0107", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 430"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0108", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 440"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0109", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 317"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 490"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0110", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 420"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0111", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 430"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0112", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 440"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 219"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "HS 108"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 68400, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 320"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 490"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 0}]}
