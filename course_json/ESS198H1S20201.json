{"id": "ESS198H1S20201", "code": "ESS198H1S", "name": "Resources and Sustainability", "description": "The rise of humanity is intricately linked to the exploitation of natural resources. From its earliest attempts to use fire and extract metals from rocks, to coal-fired steam that brought the industrial revolution, hydrocarbons that fuel international travel and trade, nuclear energy to produce electricity, and the reliance on smartphones in our daily lives, the planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resources have brought innovation and problems and require us to ask questions regarding sustainability. This course will explore the gamut from resource extraction and trading, to its societal consequences including global politics, environmental pollution, and remediation. The course will involve reading of scientific literature, student-led discussions, oral presentations and research projects, and potentially field trips to sites in Southern Ontario. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Earth Sciences", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Anderson"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 1062"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 24}]}
