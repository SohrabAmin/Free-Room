It continues with an overview of the wide ranging geochemical fields and concepts such as elemental distributions, fractionation and differentiation, and trace element cycling. The latter half of the courses leads into an introduction to basic thermodynamics as it applies to more advanced geochemical concepts found in aqueous geochemistry, mineralogy and petrology.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Earth Sciences", "prerequisites": "MAT135H1, MAT136H1, CHM135H1, ESS221H1, ESS262H1", "exclusions": "ENV233H1", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 1067"}], "size": 55, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Henderson"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 1067"}], "size": 55, "enrolment": 0}]}
