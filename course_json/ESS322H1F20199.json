Laboratory exercises familiarise students with the most common rock types, and provide practical examples of the theoretical principles discussed in lectures. This course also has a mandatory weekend field trip to view igneous and metamorphic rocks and structures in the Bancroft or Montreal area.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Earth Sciences", "prerequisites": "ESS221H1, ESS222H1, ESS223H1/ENV233H1, ESS330H1", "exclusions": "GLG318H1,GLG319H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["S Wu"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 2101"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "ES 2101"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
