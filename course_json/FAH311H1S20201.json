{"id": "FAH311H1S20201", "code": "FAH311H1S", "name": "Greek Sculpture", "description": "The course provides a thorough examination of ancient Greek sculpture from 7th - 1st century BCE, which in many ways defined the canon of western art that was to follow. Classic issues of style, dating, and technique are complemented by putting them into the contexts of cultural history, religion and socio-politics. While the course is a traditional monument-based survey of major sculptural works from the ancient Greek world, several important issues are also addressed, pertaining both to contemporary society and the study of other areas of art history. These include but are not limited to: gender, social class, colonialism, notion of the artist, originality, and aesthetic theory.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Art History", "prerequisites": "FAH207H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L5101", "instructors": ["S Kim"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 68400, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2110"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 75}]}
