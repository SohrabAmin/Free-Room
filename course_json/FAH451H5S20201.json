The emphasis of the course will be on the application of knowledge gained in FAH310 and consideration of the multi-level preparatory stages entailed in the mounting of a curatorial project, placing particular emphasis on conceptualization and methodology, and on the premise that curatorial practice is an intellectual endeavour that manifests its ideas in form. Students will learn how to turn a concept into a project proposal and become equipped to develop innovative solutions to future challenges in curatorial practice.[36S] FAH451H5\u00ffmay be counted toward either the FAH or the FAS requirements in the Art and Art History program.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Visual Studies", "prerequisites": "FAH101H5/FAH105H5/FAH202H5 and FAH310H5", "exclusions": "FAH480H, VIS320H5", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Shaw"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MN 2262"}], "size": 14, "enrolment": 14}]}
