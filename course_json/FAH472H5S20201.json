{"id": "FAH472H5S20201", "code": "FAH472H5S", "name": "Early Modern Mobile Objects", "description": "This course concerns the global circulation of objects or things in the early modern world (ca. 1500-1700) when new trade routes brought about an unprecedented mobilization of artifacts of visual culture, foodstuffs and other goods. We will be concerned with the manifold appearances of uprooted objects, new arrangements, and the invisible layers of skill, materials, and manufacture that resulted from heightened exchange. Objects of study will range broadly: porcelain, tableware and foodstuffs, screens and silver, naturalia and their elaborate mounts, miniatures, prints and books, paintings (Dutch Still Life, Las Meninas) which put the world of things on display.[24S]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Visual Studies", "prerequisites": "FAH101H5, FAH274H5 or FAH279H5 and 1.0 credit in FAH/VCC at the 300/400 level or P.I.", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
