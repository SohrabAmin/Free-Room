We will examine the ways in which these contemporary francophone artists re-write colonial histories, assert Indigenous cultural sovereignty, make place for Indigenous languages, and represent positive interpersonal relationships. The course will draw from a variety of literary genres (poetry, short story, essay, autobiography, historical fiction) as well as visual art and cinema. In addition, the works considered will be by artists from diverse nations (Wendat, Cri, Innu, Algonquin, M\u00c3\u00a9tis). In these ways, students will come to understand the many diverse forms of the contemporary Indigenous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renaissance.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The course will be held in English. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "French", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": []}
