Student and instructor work out in consultation the course's objectives, content, bibliography, and methods of approach. The material studied should bear a clear relation to the student's previous work, and should differ significantly in content and/or concentration from topics offered in regular courses. In applying to a faculty supervisor, students should be prepared to present a brief written statement of the topic they wish to explore. Final approval of the project rests with the French Discipline. Students are advised that they must obtain consent from the supervising instructor before registering for these courses.
