There are a number of scientific techniques used to characterize physical evidence, but perhaps the most utilized technique is microscopy. In this course, students will practice how to process and characterize trace evidence using a number of different microscopy techniques, such as stereomicroscope, polarized light microscope (PLM), comparison microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and confocal microscope. The theory and operation behind each microscopy technique will be discussed during lecture, while students will have the opportunity to operate the different microscopes during laboratory sessions.
