It will examine the idea of a mechanical being, of prostheses (both physical and emotional), of self-motivated matter, of narrating agency in non-human beings, and of imagining the limits of human action. In reading select texts on this topic, we will explore the physical, mental and moral qualities that purportedly separate human from non human agents. Students will gain insight into the problem of defining human beings in the context industrialization, mechanization, automation and artificial intelligence. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Germanic Languages & Literatures", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": []}
