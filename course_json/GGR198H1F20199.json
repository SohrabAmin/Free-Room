How do political conflicts both invoke and transform space and place? What kinds of alternative political relationships to space and alternative mappings can we imagine?

These may include: conflicts over the intimate spaces of the body, identity, and the home; the racialization and gendering of space; the politics of cities and urbanization; the boundaries of public and private space; struggles over land, property, resources and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; the political geographies of labour, citizenship and migration; globalization of economic markets and alternative economic political and social cartographies; borders, geopolitics, and the territorial politics of empire; and the geographic projects of colonialism, post-coloniality, modernity, and modernization.
