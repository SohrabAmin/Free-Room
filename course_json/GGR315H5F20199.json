{"id": "GGR315H5F20199", "code": "GGR315H5F", "name": "Physical Hydrology", "description": "This course centres on the advanced treatment of the physical principles involved in the occurrence and movement of water on and beneath the Earth's surface. Watershed-scale hydrologic systems are investigated, along with basic principles of fluid mechanics. Open channel hydraulics, soil water, and groundwater processes are investigated. The importance of understanding water movement in the environment by exploring the relationship of hydrology to other environmental sciences is stressed.\u00ffThis course fulfills 2 field days.\u00ff[24L, 36P]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Geography", "prerequisites": "9.0 credits including GGR214H5 or GGR217H5", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Thorne"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 210"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 46800, "duration": 10800, "location": "DV 1153"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "DV 1153"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
