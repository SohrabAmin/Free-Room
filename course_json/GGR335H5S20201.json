The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the various ways in which GIS and remote sensing have been integrated and used for environmental applications at a range of spatial and temporal scales. The course will include lectures, where foundational concepts will be introduced and practical lab sessions, where students will gain experience in the use of GIS and Remote Sensing techniques. A part of the course will be devoted to application projects employing remote sensing and/or GIS data analysis in natural resources and environmental assessments.
