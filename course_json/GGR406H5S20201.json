In an era of unprecedented human-induced environmental and climate change, research in this field is advancing rapidly. This seminar course explores the processes underlying biogeochemical cycles of major elements such as carbon and nutrients, and examines how humans alter these cycles. Topics covered include biogeochemical processes in atmospheric, aquatic and terrestrial compartments, emerging techniques (eg., stable-isotopes) used in biogeochemistry, and how disruptions to these processes are at the root of many environmental issues such as eutrophication, climate change, ocean acidification and toxic metal contamination.
