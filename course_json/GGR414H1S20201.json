Basic radiative transfer theories as applied to vegetation will be given in some detail as the basis for various remote sensing applications. Optical instruments for measuring vegetation structural parameters will be demonstrated in the field.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Geography and Planning", "prerequisites": "10 FCEs including GGR337H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": []}
