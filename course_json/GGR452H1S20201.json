{"id": "GGR452H1S20201", "code": "GGR452H1S", "name": "Space, Power, Geography: Understanding Spatiality", "description": "Our understanding of space and power has shifted radically in the past half century. Space no longer implies only regions, nations or territory; power is not simply a question of domination, control, or forms of political representation. Space and power are intricately related. This course explores a shift in our ways of thinking about space and power, focusing specifically on the works of Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. Through the works of Deleuze and Foucault, students are introduced to a variety of ways that space and power are organized and contested. The course begins with the maps in our heads: what kinds of spatial systems organize dominant world-views, how have these changed over time? What spatial metaphors do we use to think about power \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as hidden and operating at a depth, or as a surface effect? How does the social organization of space figure in the development of different technologies and techniques of power? How do technologies of power become organized, serialized, dispersed, transformed and contested?", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Geography and Planning", "prerequisites": "10.0 FCE's including at least one (or an equivalent) of GGR327H1, GGR328H1, GGR339H1, GGR352H1, GGR360H1, GGR363H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["L Stephens"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "OI 5250"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 14}]}
