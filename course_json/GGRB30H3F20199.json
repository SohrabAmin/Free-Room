The course is designed to provide hands-on experience using GIS to analyse spatial data, and create maps that effectively communicate data meanings. Students are instructed in GIS methods and approaches that are relevant not only to Geography but also to many other disciplines. In the lectures, we discuss mapping and analysis concepts and how you can apply them using GIS software. In the practice exercises and assignments, you then learn how to do your own data analysis and mapping, gaining hands-on experience with ArcGIS software, the most widely used GIS software.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Human Geography (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "GGR272H, GGR278H", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["G Brauen"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "HW 214"}], "size": 70, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 469"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0002", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 469"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}]}
