If the law is always speaking, then it must be speaking in present tense. But if it only speaks in present tense, does it have a past? How might we consider the field of law from different historical angles? This course will introduce students to different historical approaches to and uses of law. Using examples from a wide array of legal traditions (e.g. Common Law, Civil Law, Indigenous Law, Islamic Law), the course will help students gain a greater appreciation for the function, study, and development of law across different times and places.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "History", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Emon"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2102"}], "size": 175, "enrolment": 175}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 312"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "T0302", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 113"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 19}, {"code": "T5102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 113"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "T0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1078"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "T0301", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2120"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "T5101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1080"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 20}, {"code": "T5201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2101"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 18}, {"code": "T0401", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 51"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 7}, {"code": "T5202", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 113"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 9}]}
