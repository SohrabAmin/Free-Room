Whatever the rights and wrongs of its history were, the legacies of this global experience continue to influence politics in today's world. Equal coverage is given to early modern and modern history. Some background in British history or international relations is strongly recommended. This course begins at home with English expansionism in the British Isles before moving on to deal with case studies selected from North America, the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia and East Asia. Coherence comes from thematic foci consisting of economics, law, migration, gender and governance.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "History", "prerequisites": "HIS103Y1/HIS109Y1/HIS241H1/HIS244H1/HIS245H1/HIS368H1/HIS337H1/HIS349H1", "exclusions": "HISB02H3", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": []}
