Techniques range from those standard in medical practice (e.g., fitness measures, blood pressure, lung function) to current research techniques (cell culture, changes in gene expression). Students gain technical and analytical skills as they work at the bench to design and carry out individual and group experiments. Labs start in the first week of term.
