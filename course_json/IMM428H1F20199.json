The course will emphasize historical and recent experimental evidence leading to our current understanding of immune recognition. Subtopics are subject to change and have recently included mechanisms of diversification of immunoglobulin receptors, T cell \u00e2\u20ac\u201cMHC interactions, T cell activation and signaling mechanisms; receptors of the innate immune system, immune recognition by natural killer cells.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Immunology", "prerequisites": "BCH210H1/BCH242Y1, BCH311H1/CSB349H1/MGY311Y1/PSL350H1, IMM350H1/IMM351H1/IMM334Y1/IMM335Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["T Watts A Martin J Julien A Mortha"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 2170"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 2170"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
