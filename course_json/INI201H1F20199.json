We will examine the development of rhetoric over time, from the roots of the discipline in classical antiquity to the genesis of modern and postmodern rhetoric, including the New Rhetoric. We will then focus on contemporary rhetorical currents in language philosophy, gender studies, critical race studies, and affect theory.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Innis College", "prerequisites": "Completion of 4.0 full-course equivalents.", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": []}
