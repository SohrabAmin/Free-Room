These questions are not as straightforward as they appear. We work for the bulk of our lives and most of our days are spent with coworkers who are neither family nor our closest friends, but we often fail to realize how self-defining work really is. This speaks to work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centrality but also to its invisibility in reflective discourse. However, through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popular\u00e2\u20ac\u009d representations of work (e.g., such as in story-telling, cave drawings, hieroglyphs, music, writing, painting, television, film, video games, etc.,) we can begin to better understand the meaning of work and how this has changed over time. Readings in anthropology, history, economics, sociology and employment relations plus film and art criticism will help us explore these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective; assignments will encourage students to reflect on their own experience of work. Developing strong analytical and communication skills is an important goal of the course. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": []}
