In what ways are they different? This course will explore these questions, covering such topics as meaning, sound systems, the structure of words, the order of words in sentences, question formation, concepts such as subject and object, tense systems, pronoun systems. We will also discuss language loss and revival. Students will develop analytic skills as they consult published grammars and other resources to address these issues. Students will share their findings through oral and written presentation. Examples will be drawn from a wide range of languages. Restricted to first-year students.
