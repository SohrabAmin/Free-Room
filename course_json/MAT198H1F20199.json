{"id": "MAT198H1F20199", "code": "MAT198H1F", "name": "Cryptology: The Mathematics of Secrecy and Security", "description": "How do we send our own confidential information through secure channels, and how can we break codes to uncover the secret information of our adversaries? The mathematical field of cryptology is dedicated to answering such questions. In this course we will study breakthroughs in cryptology, from secret messages in the ancient world and the Enigma cipher in World War II, to modern cryptosystems that facilitate online commerce. Along the way, you will develop a sophisticated understanding of how numbers interact and develop the ability to communicate messages secretly and mathematics clearly. Restricted to first-year students.
