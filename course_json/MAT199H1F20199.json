{"id": "MAT199H1F20199", "code": "MAT199H1F", "name": "Puzzles, Mind, and Math", "description": "The course is offered in a seminar/workshop format. Each week students solve puzzles, and develop initial and essential intuitions for the fundamental ideas of each puzzle. Then in the lectures and through the reading materials, the mathematical foundations of each puzzle are studied. Students learn to apply mathematical techniques to strengthen and generalize the puzzles, and to enrich their initial problem solving intuitions. Topics covered include mathematics of numbers, counting, base and modular arithmetic, geometry and geometric constructions, graph theory, games, decision theory, logic puzzles, and recursion. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Mathematics", "prerequisites": "High school level algebra", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["S Homayouni-Boroojeni"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MY 370"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
