In this course, students will be introduced to abstraction and its power through a study of topics from discrete mathematics. The topics covered will include: Sets, relations and functions; Basic counting techniques: subsets, permutations, finite sequences, inclusion-exclusion; Discrete probability: random variables paradoxes and surprises; Basic number theory: properties of the integers and the primes. The course will emphasize active participation of the students in discussion and written assignments.
