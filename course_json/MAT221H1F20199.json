{"id": "MAT221H1F20199", "code": "MAT221H1F", "name": "Applied Linear Algebra", "description": "An application-oriented approach to linear algebra, based on calculations in standard Euclidean space. Systems of linear equations, matrices, Gauss-Jordan elimination, subspaces, bases, orthogonal vectors and projections. Matrix inverses, kernel and range, rank-nullity theorem. Determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Cramer's rule, diagonalization. This course has strong emphasis on building computational skills in the area of algebra. Applications to curve fitting, economics, Markov chains and cryptography.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Mathematics", "prerequisites": "High school level calculus", "exclusions": "MAT223H1, MATA23H3, MAT223H5, MAT224H1, MAT240H1, MAT240H5, MAT247H1, MAT247H5", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["T Janisse"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1071"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 1071"}], "size": 100, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1069"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T5101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1072"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
