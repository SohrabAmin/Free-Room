{"id": "MAT406H5F20199", "code": "MAT406H5F", "name": "Mathematical Introduction to Game Theory", "description": "Combinatorial games: Nim and other impartial games; Sprague-Grundy value; existence of a winning strategy in partisan games. Two-player (matrix) games: zero-sum games and Von-Neuman's minimax theorem; general sum-matrix games, prisoner's dilemma, Nash equilibrium, cooperative games, asymmetric information. Multi-player games: coalitions and the Shapley value. Possible additional topics: repeated (stochastic) games; auctions; voting schemes and Arrow's paradox. Mathematical tools that may be introduced include hyperplane separation of convex sets and Brouwer's fixed point theorem. Numerous examples will be analyzed in depth, to offer insight to the mathematical theory and its relation with real life situations.
