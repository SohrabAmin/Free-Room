{"id": "MATD35H3S20201", "code": "MATD35H3S", "name": "Introduction to Discrete Dynamical Systems", "description": "This course provides an introduction and exposure to dynamical systems, with particular emphasis on low-dimensional systems such as interval maps and maps of the plane. Through these simple models, students will become acquainted with the mathematical theory of chaos and will explore strange attractors, fractal geometry and the different notions of entropy. The course will focus mainly on examples rather than proofs; students will be encouraged to explore dynamical systems by programming their simulations in Mathematica.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Computer & Mathematical Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "[[MATA37H3 or MATA36H3] with a grade of B+ or higher] and MATB41H3 and MATC34H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["G Tiozzo"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "HL B110"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "AC 334"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 8}]}
