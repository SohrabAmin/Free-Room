{"id": "MATD46H3S20201", "code": "MATD46H3S", "name": "Partial Differential Equations ", "description": "This course provides an introduction to partial differential equations as they arise in physics, engineering, finance, optimization and geometry. It requires only a basic background in multivariable calculus and ODEs, and is therefore designed to be accessible to most students. It is also meant to introduce beautiful ideas and techniques which are part of most analysts' bag of tools.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Computer & Mathematical Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "[[MATA37H3 or MATA36H]3 with grade of at least B+] and MATB41H3 and MATB44H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["R Haslhofer"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "HW 408"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 24}]}
