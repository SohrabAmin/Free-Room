Although the course will cover economic foundations of strategy, market, industry and competitive analysis, the main focus will be on the internal operations of an organization. Corporate governance will be examined in the broad sense of the term and will include an overview of country-level legal environment, regulatory agencies, stock market, and the firm's board of directors. The objective of the course is to enhance students' understanding the operating tensions facing firms and the means of addressing such tensions through country-level and firm-level corporate governance systems.
