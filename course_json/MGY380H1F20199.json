Students will perform a variety of genetic and biochemical experiments to identify and characterize unknown organisms, and learn how bacteria live together in biofilm and become resistance to antibiotics. Students will also learn important research tools and concepts including CRISPRi, transduction, and conjugation through experiments. Valuable not only for advanced work in microbiology but also in related fields that make use of bacteria and bacteriophages as research tools.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Molecular Genetics", "prerequisites": "BIO120H1, BIO230H1/BIO255H1, HMB265H1/BIO260H1", "exclusions": "MGY379Y1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Liu"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "HS 696"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MS 3381"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}]}
