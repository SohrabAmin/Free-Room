Important concepts are learned through analysis of results. Topics include propagation and assay of viruses, examination of viruses by electron microscopy, replication kinetics, host response to infection and viral vectors. Valuable not only in microbiology but in fields using viruses as vectors.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Molecular Genetics", "prerequisites": "BIO120H1, BIO230H1/BIO255H1, HMB265H1/BIO260H1, MGY380H1", "exclusions": "MGY379Y1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Brown J Liu"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": ""}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 16}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MS 3381"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MS 3381"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 16}]}
