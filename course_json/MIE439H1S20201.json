Topics include cellular mechanics, blood rheology, circulatory mechanics, respiratory mechanics, skeletal mechanics, and locomotion. Applications of these topics to biomimetic and biomechanical design are emphasized through a major, integrative group project.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 325"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 303"}], "size": 85, "enrolment": 69}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Simmons"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 3202"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 3202"}], "size": 85, "enrolment": 70}]}
