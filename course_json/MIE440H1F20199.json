Hands-on experience of these topics in lectures, tutorials, and labs support successful application of the methods for the course project, as well as future design activities.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["L Shu"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 208"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "AP 120"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 71"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MB 71"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 0}]}
