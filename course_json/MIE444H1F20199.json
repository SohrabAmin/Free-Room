{"id": "MIE444H1F20199", "code": "MIE444H1F", "name": "* Mechatronics Principles", "description": "This course provides students with the tools to design, model, analyze and control mechatronic systems (e.g. smart systems comprising electronic, mechanical, fluid and thermal components). This is done through the synergic combination of tools from mechanical and electrical engineering, computer science and information technology to design systems with built-in intelligence. The class provides techniques for the modeling of various system components into a unified approach and tools for the simulation of the performance of these systems. The class also presents the procedures and an analysis of the various components needed to design and control a mechatronic system including sensing, actuating, and I/O interfacing components.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIE342H1, MIE346H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["S Colic"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 130"}], "size": 96, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 402"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 402"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 0}]}
