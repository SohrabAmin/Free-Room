Students will gain an understanding of the steps involved and the tools utilized in developing new products. The course will integrate both business and engineering concepts seamlessly through examples, case studies and a final project. Some of the business concepts covered include: identifying customer needs, project management and the economics of product design. The engineering design tools include: developing product specifications, concept generation, concept selection, Product Functional Decomposition diagrams, orthogonal arrays, full and fractional factorials, noises, interactions, tolerance analysis and latitude studies. Specific emphasis will be placed on robust and tunable technology for product optimization.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIE231H1/MIE236H1 or equivalent, MIE243H1 or instructor's permission", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 72000, "end": 75600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 252"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 99}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Nacson"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 252"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 110}]}
