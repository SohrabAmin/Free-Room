{"id": "MSE160H1S20201", "code": "MSE160H1S", "name": "Molecules and Materials", "description": "This course will cover both the fundamentals and applications of molecular chemistry as it relates to the properties of materials. Fundamental topics will include: (1) the design of chemical structures and their relationship to optical and electronic properties; (2) the chemistry and physics of covalent and non-covalent bonding; (3) the relationship of atomic bonding to molecular geometry and local symmetry; (4) crystal structures of extended solids; and (5) extension of these principles to electronic structure, elasticity, and vector and tensor descriptions of materials properties. Applications to diverse areas of engineering will be discussed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "MSE101H1 or APS104H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 303"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 72}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1101"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 63}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 303"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 93}, {"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1210"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 60}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["S Ramsay H Ruda"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}], "size": 9999, "enrolment": 288}]}
