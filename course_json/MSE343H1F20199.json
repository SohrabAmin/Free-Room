Key applications of materials for biomedical devices will be covered, along with an introduction to the expected biological responses. The concept of biocompatibility will be introduced along with the essential elements of biology related to an understanding of this criterion for biomaterial selection and implant design. In addition, structure-property relationships in both biological and bio-inspired materials will be highlighted.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Sone"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 330"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 330"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 330"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 3201"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
