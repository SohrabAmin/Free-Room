Both the material properties and the capabilities of applicable fabrication processes are considered to identify the material and process which best satisfy the design requirements. Extensive use is made of an integrated materials properties and processes database system.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["Z Saadatnia Y Kazemi"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1071"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1071"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1071"}], "size": 77, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 150"}], "size": 77, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 304"}], "size": 77, "enrolment": 0}]}
