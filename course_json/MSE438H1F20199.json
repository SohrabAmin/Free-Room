{"id": "MSE438H1F20199", "code": "MSE438H1F", "name": "Computational Materials Design", "description": "This course will provide a broad overview of the modern computational materials design approaches at various length scales. At the atomic scale, we will cover density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and atomistic kinetic Monte-Carlo. Mesoscale simulations of material behavior will involve dislocation dynamics and phase-field models. At the continuum scale, computational fracture mechanics and plasticity modeling will be covered. Finally, students will be exposed to the concepts and case-studies pertaining to multi-scale modeling. Hands-on training will be provided on software such as LAMMPS and Quantum-ESPRESSO.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Singh"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 119"}], "size": 65, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["C Singh"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 1013"}], "size": 65, "enrolment": 0}]}
