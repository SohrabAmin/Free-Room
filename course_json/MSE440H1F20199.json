{"id": "MSE440H1F20199", "code": "MSE440H1F", "name": "Emerging Applications in Biomaterials", "description": "This course will build directly on the material covered in MSE343, and is open to CHE students. It will cover emerging applications for ceramic, polymeric and metallic biomaterials, highlighting their use as tissue replacements in addition to drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and biosensing applications. Aspects of new materials design and fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing, will be discussed in a broader context of biomedical device design. Course projects involve studies of new biomaterials research, and current commercial medical devices. This course may also incorporate aspects of computational modelling.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "MSE343H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["B Hatton"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 320"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 440"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 440"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
