{"id": "MSE459H1F20199", "code": "MSE459H1F", "name": "Synthesis of Nanostructured Materials", "description": "Various synthesis techniques to produce nanostructured materials will be introduced. These include methods involving the vapor phase (physical and chemical vapor deposition, organometallic chemical vapor deposition), the liquid phase (rapid solidification, spark erosion), the solid phase, (mechanical attrition, equal channel deformation) as well techniques producing these structures from solution (electrodeposition, electroless processing, precipitation). Secondary processing techniques to produce final products or devices will also be discussed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["U Erb"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 350"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["U Erb D Grozea"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 51"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
