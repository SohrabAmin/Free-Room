In this course, we will look at an early generation of educated Iranian females who although from varied backgrounds have a common desire to make their lives public. We will refer to a mix of sources including memoirs, interviews and poems to explore how feminist aspirations are repressed or expressed in a society dominated by patriarchal values. We will analyse how a woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s childhood experience affects her personal expectations for the future and whether the cultural environment restricted this generation or encouraged women to make a social contribution. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Near & Middle Eastern Civilizations", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Sandler"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2114"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 24}]}
