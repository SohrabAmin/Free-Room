The focus is on seminal case-studies of materials from around the world, and in particular on material from the Middle East, Central America, and East Asia that UofT researchers have studied, ranging in date from Neolithic to modern. Labs comprise eight three-hour sessions during the term, working with the polarized-light microscope to examine and analyze thin-sections.
