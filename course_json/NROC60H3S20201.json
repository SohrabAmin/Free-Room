Advanced systems, cellular and molecular neuroscience techniques will be covered within the context of understanding how the brain processes complex behaviour. Practical experience on brain slicing, immunohistochemistry and cell counting will feature in the completion of a lab project examining the cellular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits. These experiments do not involve contact with animals.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Psychology (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "NROC36H3 or NROC61H3 or NROC69H3", "exclusions": "PSY399H", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["M Arruda Carvalho"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 61200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 316"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 21}, {"code": "P0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 148"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 19}]}
