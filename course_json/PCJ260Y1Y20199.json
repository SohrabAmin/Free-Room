{"id": "PCJ260Y1Y20199", "code": "PCJ260Y1Y", "name": "Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies", "description": "The course reviews theories exploring the causes of conflict, the possibilities for the pursuit of peace, and the role of justice in both. Drawing on a wide range of disciplines and perspectives, including political science, psychology, sociobiology, economics, and religion, it offers an introduction to diverse approaches to conflict resolution and peace-building. After examining the role of individual characteristics, social group dynamics, and structural processes in generating conflict, the course interrogates different conceptions of peace and justice as well as the dilemmas involved in pursuing them in practice. Case studies and examples are used to help students apply the conceptual tools they acquire to prominent world conflicts.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy", "prerequisites": "Only for current PCJ program students in second year and higher/permission of the Program Director", "exclusions": "PCS260Y1, UNI110Y1, UNI260Y1", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Lerner"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2125"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2125"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2125"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
