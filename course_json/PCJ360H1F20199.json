{"id": "PCJ360H1F20199", "code": "PCJ360H1F", "name": "Topics in Peace, Conflict and Justice: Fairness", "description": "The difference between peace and conflict can hinge on agreement or disagreement about what is just and fair. This course explores fairness from multiple perspectives to shed light on why a shared conception of fairness is often hard to achieve. Through recent readings from developmental, social, moral and cultural psychology, as well as behavioral economics, students gain a practical understanding of the current state of the psychological science research on the topic. Students are asked to critically examine the implications of the existing evidence for an understanding of the universality and diversity inherent in fairness judgments. Crucially, students apply their learning to historical and contemporary conflicts, from inside the home to across national boundaries.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy", "prerequisites": "PCJ260Y1 or permission of the Program Director.", "exclusions": "PCS360Y1, UNI360Y1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Clark"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 1088"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
