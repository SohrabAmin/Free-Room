Students work in teams of 2-7 students, and help partner organizations solve important problems. Student teams mostly work independently of the organization, while receiving some mentoring, critique, and advice from the organizations. Students are expected to invest 5-7 hours per week in course projects, in addition to class time. In this non-competitive course, students are asked to engage in deep personal reflection, help teammates, advise other teams, and contribute their skills and talents to their community partners. The course will emphasize how groups work to achieve community goals, how grassroots politics works, the power of social capital, and how these topics link to questions of conflict resolution, brokering piece, and achieving justice.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy", "prerequisites": "PCJ260Y1", "exclusions": "PCJ361H1, PCJ363H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Clark"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "OI 5150"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 35}]}
