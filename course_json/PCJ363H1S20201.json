Students are asked to situate their training from the PCJ program within the context of their academic study abroad experiences, though they may also have the opportunity to reflect on volunteer, activist, and social experiences. In written assignments, students are required to reflect on how their thinking has been influenced by their study abroad experiences, what they will do with their new perspectives upon returning to the University of Toronto, and how these affect how they think about peace, conflict, and justice.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy", "prerequisites": "PCJ260Y1", "exclusions": "PCJ361H1, PCJ362H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L9901", "instructors": ["D Clark"], "times": [], "size": 25, "enrolment": 11}]}
