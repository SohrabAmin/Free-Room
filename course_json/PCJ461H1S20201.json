{"id": "PCJ461H1S20201", "code": "PCJ461H1S", "name": "Research Methods in Peace, Conflict and Justice", "description": "This course guides each student through their own individual research project, embedded in an interactive group learning process, in order to offer an applied introduction to research methods for peace, conflict and justice studies. Students work through the full research process, including: identifying a research question, learning how to conduct effective literature reviews, developing a rigorous research design, and applying quantitative and qualitative methods to answering questions. Rather than conducting research independently or studying research methods in isolation, the course combines the two: students learn collectively about the different steps in the research process while simultaneously applying those steps to their own research project. This is then complemented by presenting that research and discussing different research projects in class, so as to receive continuous feedback and be exposed to a variety of research methods and approaches.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy", "prerequisites": "PCJ460H1; enrolment restricted to students enrolled in the Peace, Conflict and Justice Specialist program", "exclusions": "PCS460Y1, PCS461H1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Salardi"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 581"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 8}]}
