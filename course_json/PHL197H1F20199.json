{"id": "PHL197H1F20199", "code": "PHL197H1F", "name": "Introduction to Philosophical Anthropology", "description": "Philosophical anthropology is the subject that poses the most fundamental questions about human nature and the human condition. Taking as its point of departure the most up-to-date scientific understanding of human nature, from anthropology broadly conceived, it goes on to inquire, in a disciplined fashion, about the implications of these views for perennial philosophical questions about human rationality, morality, the possibility of progress, the existence of god and the meaning of life. This course will examine one or more topics in this domain, as a more general introduction to the discipline. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Philosophy", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Heath"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2120"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
