{"id": "PHL199H1F20199", "code": "PHL199H1F", "name": "Trump, the Rule of Law and the Rise of Illiberal Democracy", "description": "This seminar will examine the important idea in our culture of the rule of law - the idea that there is a virtue to having what the state can do to its subjects governed by law. It will investigate concrete examples of what happens when the rule of law is put under stress, as is arguably the case under the Trump administration. It will also examine the way in which these developments are related to the rise of what gets called 'illiberal democracy', a notion celebrated by Victor Orban in Hungary, and by other Central and Eastern European politicians. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Philosophy", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Dyzenhaus"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2114"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
