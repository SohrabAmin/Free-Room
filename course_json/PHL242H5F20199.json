{"id": "PHL242H5F20199", "code": "PHL242H5F", "name": "Science Fiction and Philosophy", "description": "Science fiction is a rich resource for philosophical thinking. Are we in a matrix? Are there alternative realities? Is teleportation, or telepathy, or telekinesis, or time travel, possible? In addition, philosophical thought experiments often include elements of science fiction, like twin-earths, zombies, swamp people, inverted spectra, brain-splitting, eternal recurrences, and evil demons. This course considers these topics -- both some philosophy of science fiction and some science fiction in philosophy.
