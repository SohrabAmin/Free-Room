{"id": "PHY100H5F20199", "code": "PHY100H5F", "name": "What's Physics Got to Do With It?", "description": "Stephen Hawking once said: \"We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.\" The magic of Physics, with its ambitious goals of pushing the boundaries of knowledge, from finding the \"God particle\" to predicting the fate of the Universe, will be the focus of this course. The course is intended for those who are not trained in Physics and Mathematics but who nevertheless want to gain insight into this interesting and important field in a non-intimidating way. We will discover important concepts and theories through applications to everyday phenomena, including new energy sources, laser surgery, flat-screen TVs, wireless communications, GPS, etc. More advanced, but nevertheless fascinating and popular topics, will also be covered: time travel, relativity, ultracold atoms, quantum entanglement, black holes and the Higgs boson. No previous background in Physics is expected; high school algebra is recommended.
