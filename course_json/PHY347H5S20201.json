{"id": "PHY347H5S20201", "code": "PHY347H5S", "name": "Optics", "description": "This course focuses mainly on providing a strong foundation of wave optics, while also presenting advanced geometrical optics aspects and an introduction to modern optics and the quantum nature of light. The topics in this course may vary but will include: electromagnetic waves and the propagation of light, basic coherence concepts and the interference of light, Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction, matrix methods in paraxial optics, Fresnel equations, polarization and birefringence. Technical applications will accompany the lectures, allowing students to put into practice the optical principles learned during the lecture by performing laboratory experiments with lasers and other optical devices.
