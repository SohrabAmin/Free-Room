{"id": "PHY351H5F20199", "code": "PHY351H5F", "name": "Climate Physics", "description": "This course presents the physics of Earth?s climate. Emphasis will be placed on the basic principles and processes involved in physical and dynamic climatology and the physical interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. Topics may include components of the climate system and global energy balance, atmospheric radiative transfer, surface energy balance, the hydrological cycle, general circulation of the atmosphere, ocean circulation and climate, climate modeling, and climate change. In the lab practicals, students will gain hands-on experience in analyzing climate data and simple climate modeling.
