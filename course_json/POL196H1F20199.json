While many analysts see Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise as posing a threat to global political and economic stability, Chinese leaders have argued forcefully that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to regain its historic preeminence will result in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwin-win\u00e2\u20ac\u009d outcome for all states. This course will assess the merits of these contending positions through an historical examination of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20th century renaissance. The course will begin by tracing the long period of imperial decline in the 19th century, culminating in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revolutionary rebirth as a Marxist state in 1949. A major focus will be on the Mao-era legacy of revolutionary diplomacy and the foreign policy consequences of its later transformation into a market-authoritarian powerhouse.
