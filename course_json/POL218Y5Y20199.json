{"id": "POL218Y5Y20199", "code": "POL218Y5Y", "name": "Introduction to Comparative Politics", "description": "An introduction to the main themes, concepts and methods in comparative politics. Comparative politics compares the ways people and institutions interact, in different countries and regions of the world (including both developing and developed), to produce what we call \"politics.\" The course brings to bear different interpretive frameworks (political culture, political economy, identity politics, and institutional analysis) to help us understand this interaction. Topics include: the formation, development and eventual decay of political institutions such as the nation-state, political regimes, parties, party systems and local governments; the ideas and interests shaping political behaviour; and the reasons why, and the ways in which, groups mobilize politically.
