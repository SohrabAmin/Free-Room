{"id": "POL469H1F20199", "code": "POL469H1F", "name": "Ethics and International Relations", "description": "The course aims to explore the requirements of justice and fairness in international affairs. It is common to theorize international relations in terms of interests and power. But even the most cursory look at what important actors actually do in their international interactions reveals that they use normative language all the time. This has not gone unnoticed, with investigations of ethics in the international arena multiplying in recent years. Drawing on readings from political philosophy, legal theory, and normative international relations theory, the course will take up practical ethical dilemmas encountered in world affairs. The main focus of the course will be on institutions. Examples will be drawn from the issue areas of trade, health, and the environment, among others.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Political Science", "prerequisites": "POL208Y1/POL208Y5/(POLB80H3, POLB81H3)", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["N Bertoldi"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "LA 214"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}]}
