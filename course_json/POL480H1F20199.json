The course neither presupposes background knowledge of any non-Western thought tradition, nor does it aspire to provide students with sufficient knowledge of particular traditions to ground serious scholarly contributions to this emerging field. To provide that background would require a series of specialized courses in, e.g., East Asian political thought, Indian political thought, Latin American political thought, Indigenous political thought, African political thought, and so on. Rather, the course aims at sharpening our understanding of (a) the purposes served by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deparochializing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d political theory; and (b) the various methods by which we can seek to serve these purposes.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Political Science", "prerequisites": "POL200Y1/POL200Y5/POL320Y1/POL320Y5/JPP343H1/JPP343Y1/(POLC70H3, POLC71H3)", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Walton"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "OI 4426"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}]}
