Cases considered will include: Canada, UK, Spain, Germany, Australia, America, India and South Africa.Area of Focus: Comparative Politics", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Political Science (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "POLB30H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["F Kahraman"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MW 110"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
