The course begins by introducing important theoretical debates concerning collective action in the region - focusing on such concepts as citizenship, the public sphere, civil society, and social movements. The second part of the course examines case studies of social action - examining the roles played by crucial actors such as labour, the rising Islamist middle classes/bourgeoisie, the region's various ethnic and religious minority groups, and women who are entering into the public sphere in unprecedented numbers. The course concludes by examining various forms of collective and non-collective action in the region from Islamist social movements to everyday forms of resistance.Area of Focus: Comparative Politics", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Political Science (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "POLB90H3 and [POLB91H3 or POLB92H3]", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["M Gordner"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MW 140"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
