Students are placed with community organizations within the Greater Toronto Area and volunteer for 2 hours per week, furthering their language skills and their cultural knowledge. Class work focuses on developing students' communication skills through exposure to a range of topics, from financial, legal, medical to educational, and to an extensive variety of styles and registers in Portuguese. Therefore, students meet real needs in the community by applying knowledge from their Portuguese courses.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Spanish and Portuguese", "prerequisites": "PRT320Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": []}
