Neuroscience, the scientific exploration of the brain, is beginning to unravel how this amazing structure works. In this course, you will learn the fundamental anatomical organization and physiological properties of the brain. You will develop a greater understanding of the structures of the brain, how neurons communicate, and the processes that give rise to perception, learning, and memory.
