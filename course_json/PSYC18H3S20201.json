{"id": "PSYC18H3S20201", "code": "PSYC18H3S", "name": "The Psychology of Emotion", "description": "What is an emotion? How are emotions experienced and how are they shaped? What purpose do emotions serve to human beings? What happens when our emotional responses go awry? Philosophers have debated these questions for centuries. Fortunately, psychological science has equipped us with the tools to explore such questions on an empirical level. Building with these tools, this course will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific study of emotion. Topics will include how emotions are expressed in our minds and bodies, how emotions influence (and are influenced by) our thoughts, relationships, and cultures, and how emotions can both help us thrive and make us sick. A range of perspectives, including social, cultural, developmental, clinical, and cognitive psychology, will be considered.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Psychology (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "PSYB10H3 and [(PSYB01H3) or (PSYB04H3) or PSYB70H3] and [ PSYB07H3 or STAB22H3 or STAB23H3]", "exclusions": "PSY331H, (PSY394H), PSY494H", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L30", "instructors": ["R Teper"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 75600, "duration": 7200, "location": "AC 223"}], "size": 350, "enrolment": 350}]}
