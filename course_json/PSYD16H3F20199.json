{"id": "PSYD16H3F20199", "code": "PSYD16H3F", "name": "Critical Analysis in Social Psychology", "description": "The development of social psychology is examined both as a discipline (its phenomena, theory, and methods) and as a profession. The Natural and Human Science approaches to phenomena are contrasted. Students are taught to observe the lived-world, choose a social phenomenon of interest to them, and then interview people who describe episodes from their lives in which these phenomena occurred. The students interpret these episodes and develop theories to account for their phenomena before searching for scholarly research on the topic.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Psychology (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "[(PSYB01H3) or (PSYB04H3) or PSYB70H3] and [PSYB07H3 or STAB22H3 or STAB23H3] and [[PSYB10H3 and 0.5 credit at the C-level in PSY courses] or [PSYC12H3 or (PSYC11H3) or PSYC71H3]]", "exclusions": "PSY420H", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["G Cupchik"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "HL B108"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
