Re-enchantment, a term increasingly encountered in popular and academic contexts alike, demonstrates nostalgia for an enchanted past, a discomfort with the modern narrative, and a desire to recover wonder. This course will examine the history of enchantment through a series of readings taken from literature, philosophy, theology, ranging from Plato to contemporary magical realism. Restricted to first-year students. Not available for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Department for the Study of Religion", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Hampton"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "OI 3310"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 24}]}
