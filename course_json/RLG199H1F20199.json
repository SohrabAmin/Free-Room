That is, according to Kant, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to grow up. Our immaturity is facilitated especially by religion, whose demands for deference to the authority of texts, traditions, and gods often prevent us from taking full responsibility for our thoughts and actions. But need religion play this role? Is there a religion for grown-ups? This course explores those questions by reading autobiographical accounts of philosophers who describe how their study of philosophy either strengthened or strangled their youthful religious convictions.
