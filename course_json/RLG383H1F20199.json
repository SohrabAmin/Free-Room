Do we always impose our preconceptions on them? Or are there cognitive, imaginative, and emotional resources that enable us to see people on their own terms? These questions, which beset the practices of anthropologists and historians of religions, are central to the philosophy of the human sciences. This course explores the theoretical issues involved in interpretation and dialogue across cultural and historical divides by reading seminal texts by Dilthey, Collingwood, Heidegger, Quine, Davidson, Winch, MacIntyre, Benedict, Geertz, and Rorty.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Department for the Study of Religion", "prerequisites": "Completion of 4.0 credits", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["S Goldberg"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "JH 317"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
