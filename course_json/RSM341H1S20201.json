{"id": "RSM341H1S20201", "code": "RSM341H1S", "name": "Model-Based Decision Making", "description": "This course aims to introduce logically disciplined approaches to decision making under uncertainty. Managers are continually barraged with information that may be unreliable. They must choose courses of action in the face of many uncertainties. How can we define and assess the \"optimality\" of their decisions in a consistent manner? By building upon the answers to these questions, the course will consider the problem of rational choice when the outcome is determined by the actions of, and interactions between, multiple individuals.
