{"id": "SDS354H1F20199", "code": "SDS354H1F", "name": "Theories of Sexuality I: Western Trajectories", "description": "This course offers a survey of some key texts and narratives that have traversed and structured Western conceptualizations of sexuality from Greek antiquity to the 19th century. We will examine a variety of literary, philosophical and medical sources in light of what they say about past conceptualizations of the body, desire and its pleasures, and we will ask how they resonate with, or radically differ from, our current understandings of bodily norms, passions and transgressions.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Sexual Diversity Studies", "prerequisites": "SDS255H1/SDS256H1/UNI255H1/UNI256H1", "exclusions": "UNI354H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": []}
