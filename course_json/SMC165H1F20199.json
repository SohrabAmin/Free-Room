{"id": "SMC165H1F20199", "code": "SMC165H1F", "name": "SMC One: The Boyle Seminar in Scripts and Stories", "description": "This seminar introduces students to university-level studies through an interdisciplinary exploration of Celtic influences in the mediaeval world, with a particular focus on early books and historical artifacts as physical objects and bearers of meaning. Students will learn how to read and analyse these books and artifacts to decode their meanings, and, in support of that, take introductory language instruction in Latin or Irish. Subjects discussed will include intercultural encounter and dialogue, research methods with historical sources, and the relationship between the written word and lived experience, then and now. There is a co-curricular travel opportunity to Dublin, Ireland associated with this course which is strongly recommended. The costs of this travel opportunity are covered by the University of St. Michael's College. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option. (A fee of up to $1000 will apply for travel costs.)", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "St. Michael's College", "prerequisites": "Admission to SMC One", "exclusions": "Innis One, Munk One, New One, Trinity One, Vic One, UC One, Woodsworth One, SMC155H1, SMC188H1, SMC189H1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A More M Coilfeir"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "TF 101"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "CR 107"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "CR 106"}], "size": 16, "enrolment": 0}]}
