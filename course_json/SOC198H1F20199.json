Social networks are the webs of connections between people, the mesh that weaves people into communities and societies. In this course, you will learn about social networks by examining the ones around you: what do student's social networks look like? How do they change from high school, to university, and beyond? You will learn, first hand, how researchers study social networks, and how we work to understand their association with important outcomes like academic achievement, graduation, job-finding, and more. Restricted to first-year students.
