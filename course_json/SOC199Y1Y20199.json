The seminar will include an examination of seminal writings about people's use of time and hands-on practice in the strategies and techniques of analyzing available data, including the formulation of questions and approaches to answering them. Students will acquire an appreciation not only of the concept of time and how it helps explain important issues in the social sciences but also of how they use time in their daily lives and how time-use analysis can help them better understand many situations. Several skills will be developed in this seminar, including reading, writing, expressing points of view, and asking and answering research questions by using numerical data and computers to organize, analyze, and show results clearly. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Sociology", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["W Michelson"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "FE 36"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
