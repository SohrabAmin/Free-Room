{"id": "SOC230H5F20199", "code": "SOC230H5F", "name": "The Sociological Enterprise", "description": "This course builds on the foundational sociological principles and ideas taught in SOC100H5. It does so through an engagement with significant projects, typically books, and will build students' writing abilities at the same time. Each week the course will engage with issues facing sociologists studying in a particular area, such as criminology, gender, work, political sociology, cultural sociology, and health, as well as other major subfields within the discipline. As part of the course, students will be asked to consider different ways to think and write about the individual and society, social processes, stratification, inequality, organizations, demography, power, and social change.
