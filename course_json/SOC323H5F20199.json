{"id": "SOC323H5F20199", "code": "SOC323H5F", "name": "Law and Society", "description": "This course is primarily concerned with the relationship between legal, social and moral regulation. The law can either promote social change or defend the status quo. Most of us believe that the law reinforces certain social values (justice, rights, equality and fairness). This course critically assesses the extent to which law embodies these values, and how these values are challenged by different segments of society. The course will outline key debates about the power of law and legal governance.
