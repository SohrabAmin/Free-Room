In addition to producing and interpreting regression models, this course also focuses on diagnostic tools for addressing outliers and multicolinearity, as well as regression with categorical independent variables and dependent variables (including a basic introduction to logistic regression). This course is mainly project based. Students will develop their own research questions and hypotheses and use statistical software to analyze data in order to provide evidence for their hypotheses. All students in the Sociology and Criminology, Law and Society Specialist programs are required to take this course.
