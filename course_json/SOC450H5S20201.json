{"id": "SOC450H5S20201", "code": "SOC450H5S", "name": "Walls to Bridges: Carceral Seminar", "description": "Based on the Walls to Bridges Program model, this seminar course matches a group of University of Toronto Mississauga students (\"outside\" students) with an approximately equal number of incarcerated students (\"inside\" students) who study together as peers at an off-campus setting. Topics vary from term to term. All class sessions are held inside the institution (e.g., penitentiary, detention centre, halfway house, etc.). Inside and outside students work together on small teams to develop and present a final project. Interested students should submit an application to the Department of Sociology (see website for details), and an interview may be required. Preference given to eligible Criminology, Law and Society Specialists and Majors. [36S] Once students are accepted into this course a criminal record check (CPIC) may be required to access the offsite location for classes. Students are advised to schedule approximately seven hours for class time (to allow time sufficient time for travel, institution check-in and -out in addition to the seminar time).", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Sociology", "prerequisites": "SOC205H5/SOC231H5, SOC209H5, SOC221H5, SOC222H5, 4th Year Standing, P.I.", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
