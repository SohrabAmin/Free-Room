{"id": "SPA196H1F20199", "code": "SPA196H1F", "name": "Class and Work in the Americas", "description": "This course examines economic and social inequalities in the contemporary Americas. We look at the ways in which class divisions are represented in academic studies, literature, film, and television. From Mexican maquiladoras to indigenous reservations, we consider the global poor and how recent changes in the character of work (automation, outsourcing, free trade zones) have had an impact on class divisions, especially for younger members of society. Can a renewed understanding of class and work help us to negotiate power, privilege, and inequality in this century? Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Spanish and Portuguese", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Jagoe"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "EM 302"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
