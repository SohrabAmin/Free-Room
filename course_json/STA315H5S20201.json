The course will also cover the modern statistics in the \"big data\" area. The high dimensional problems when p >> n and n >> p will be introduced. In addition, the students will be formed as groups to do data analysis projects on statistical machine learning and present their findings in class. This will prepare them for future careers in industry or academia.
