We begin by exploring the most important advancements in global health policy over the past two decades. We then assess Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience in providing health care, identifying lessons for national policy reform and for Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a leader in global health research and policy.
