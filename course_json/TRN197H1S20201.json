The legacy of historical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Viking activities\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was a factor in the development of modern nation states in Scandinavia and the Baltic region, and their contributions to the heritage of people residing in Britain, continental Europe, the Middle East, and even the Atlantic coast of Canada have been and continue to be cited to the present day. Aspects of culture attributed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Vikings\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtheir assumed independence, courage, resourcefulness, and tenacity in the face of adversity, as well as the occult characteristics of their cosmology\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhave, for better and worse, inspired modern artists, writers, composers, intellectuals, explorers and even political leaders, and persist in present day literature, art, music, sport and popular culture as well. Why and how do elements of historic Viking culture continue to evoke traditions and characteristics popularly attributed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Vikings\u00e2\u20ac\u009d? What are some implications of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Viking-ness\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for those people in the post-Viking Age past and/or present who we may regard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor may regard themselves\u00e2\u20ac\u201das the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cultural descendants\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the Vikings? In this seminar, participants will study selected cultural artifacts of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153post-Viking Age,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d along with recent multidisciplinary research, to observe how various \u00e2\u20ac\u0153post-Viking Age\u00e2\u20ac\u009d cultures and subcultures have selectively appropriated elements of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Viking\u00e2\u20ac\u009d past.
