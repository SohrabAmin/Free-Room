Recent research has revised the traditional view of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vikings\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as primarily marauding warriors; in its place, a more complex and nuanced conception of the implications that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Viking activity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d had on the social, economic, and political development of the peoples with whom they came in contact has emerged. This seminar will consider the relationship between the traditional conception of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Viking warrior\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and recent research that suggests the broader impact that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Viking Phenomenon\u00e2\u20ac\u009d had upon the economic revival and sociopolitical development of medieval Europe and its frontiers. In the course of the seminar, we will examine a selection of historical records and information concerning artifacts of the material culture of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Viking Age\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in order to better understand the activities of early medieval \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vikings,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d not only as warriors, but also as agents of commerce, explorers, pioneers, and rulers.
