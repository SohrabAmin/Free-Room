In part two of the course, we will study Karl Marx, who coined the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to describe the new type of society that had emerged as a product of the Industrial Revolution. Marx, as the severest critic of the capitalist system, called attention to its alienating character. In the 19th Century, his ideas provoked a response that accounts, in large measure, for the character of Western political thought. The discussion of Marx is therefore followed by the intense debate with his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ghost,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the Marxian legacy. We will engage with the participants in the debate - - Weber, Pareto, Mosca, Michels, Durkheim, and Mannheim. Restricted to first-year students.
