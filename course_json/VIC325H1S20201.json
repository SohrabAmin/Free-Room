The course will look at the usage of semiotics to study how meaning is negotiated in interactive media versus the older and still extant one-way media (print and radio, for example). The course will utilize actual media materials (comic books, television programs, text messages, and so on) on which semiotic analysis can be conducted.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Victoria College", "prerequisites": "VIC220Y1/VIC223Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Granata"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "NF 006"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 41}]}
