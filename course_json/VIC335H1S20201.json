The main goal is to develop critical perspectives on enterprises in the widest sense, including start-up companies, non-profits, arts institutions, community outreach organizations, and social activism. What would make these changes ethical? When we evaluate the endeavours, how can we compare economic benefits, social disruption, questions of exclusion and diversity, sustainability in several senses, and the processes of change themselves? Where are the limits of social responsibility in entrepreneurial creativity?", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Victoria College", "prerequisites": "6.0 FCE in any subject", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Gibbs"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "VC 206"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 17}]}
