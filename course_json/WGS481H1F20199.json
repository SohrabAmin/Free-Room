{"id": "WGS481H1F20199", "code": "WGS481H1F", "name": "Gender, Sexuality and Black Liberation from Black Power to #BlackLivesMatter", "description": "This course maps genealogies of black insurgency and transnational itineraries of intersectional theorizing, organizing, and praxis from the 20th century to our present moment. Through close study of works by and about black revolutionary migrants, exiles, intellectuals, fugitives, and so-called terrorists, participants will critique and create radical visions for emancipation. Major topics and themes may include black feminisms; queer insurgencies; transnational imaginaries and solidarities; silence and intracommunal violence; accountability and transformative justice. Through collective discussion, writing, and reflection we interrogate visions and strategies of emancipation, and imagine radical futures historically and in our own times.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Women and Gender Studies Institute", "prerequisites": "WGS160Y1, one full course at the 300+ level in WGS, and one half course in WGS", "exclusions": "WGS435H1 (Topics: Sex, Gender and Revolution from Black Power to #BlackLivesMatter), offered in Winter 2017 and Fall 2017", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
